# 03_Github_MCP_Server: Sales Price Update and GitHub Repository Operations

This project involves a Python script to modify a CSV file, specifically updating 'Sale price' values, and demonstrates concepts related to GitHub repository management, though some steps were initially uncompleted due to environment limitations.

## Functionality:

-   **CSV File Modification:**
    -   The `update_csv.py` script reads `white heaven.csv`.
    -   It identifies and updates all 'Sale price' values in the CSV to `4800`.
    -   The modified data is then written to `updated_white_heaven.csv`.

## How to use the script:

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the script using: `python update_csv.py`

## Uncompleted GitHub Steps (Initial Environment Limitations):

*Initially, this project attempted to perform Git repository initialization, GitHub repository creation, and code pushing, but these steps could not be completed directly within the execution environment due to `git` and `python` commands not being in the system's PATH.*

*(Note: These GitHub operations are now being handled by the Gemini CLI for the overall project.)*
